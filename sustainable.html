      <h1>THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS NOT SUSTAINABLE</h1>
      <h2>... We are trying to change that</h2>
    </div>
      <p>
        At SILFEN sustainability means putting action behind words, considering
        all stakeholders and always aiming a little bit higher when creating
        another collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a young, global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the
        planet, not only for our own sake, but for all future generations to
        come.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why every piece is made with sustainable fabrics, for an
        experience that is not only luxurious, but responsible.

                <h4>Organic cotton</h4>
                <p>Organic cotton has the same qualities as conventional cotton but without the same environmental  impact, as it is grown without the use of pesticides, insecticides or fertiliser. 
                </p>
                <p>80 percent of organic cotton globally is grown in rainfed conditions. As a result, organic cotton has 91% lower water consumption than regular cotton.</p>
                <p>Farming practices used in organic agriculture, such as crop rotation, green manure, composting, reduced tillage, and the recycling of crop residue, helps increase the amount of organic matter in the soil. This improves water quality in agriculture areas where pollution has been a problem in the past. 
                </p>
                <p>Organic agriculture offers a market-oriented solution to poverty among small farming communities and increases food security through crop rotation. Organic cotton also promotes gender equality as woman are more attracted to organic farming, increasing their financial independence.</p>

                <h4>Recycled plastic</h4>
                <p>rPET leaves a smaller carbon footprint. It's 100% recyclable, Not only can it be cleaned and reused, it can also be recycled over and over again.</p>
                <p>Creating a product out of rPet uses 75% less energy than new Pet (polyethylene terephthalate)</p>
                <p>RPET production produces 65.5% less carbon than virgin polyester.
                </p>
                <p>RPET production needs 1/10th of water compared to virgin polyester.</p><p>RPET’s production needs only 30% of the energy required for virgin polyester’s production.</p>
                <p>Using plastic isn’t ideal but finding new life for already created plastics is a step in the right direction. </p>

                <h3>WORKING CONDITIONS & SHIPPING</h3>
                <p>We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as much as possible – by joining forces. We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping, reducing polluting emissions.</p>
                <p>At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put their children in school.</p>
                <p>Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.
                </p>
                <p>We support the different religions of employees and protect their right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
                </p>
                <p>We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is always crafted in a responsible manner.
                </p><p>All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.</p>

                <h3>OUR GOALS FOR THE FUTURE</h3>
                <p>At SILFEN we are trying our best to be more sustainable and save the environment. </p>
                <p>We still have a long way to go to be 100% sustainable. Below, you can read all about our goals for the future</p>

            <section class="goalsList">
                <h3>Goal 1 - SHIPPING</h3>
               <p>Current global circumstances have made it impossible to send our goods by ship or train. All products from our factories and warehouses and transported by plane. This is something we are aware of and are trying to rectify as soon as it is possible for us to do so. </p>
             <h3>Goal 2 - FACTORY VISITS</h3>
             <p>Since SILFEN began we have carried out regular visits to our production partners China, Turkey and India. Due to the global pandemic, visiting our factories in has been impossible. This is soon will change when it has been declared safe to travel to all countries and we can meet face to face with our workers again. </p>
             <h3>Goal 3</h3>
