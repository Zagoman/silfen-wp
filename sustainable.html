          <p>
            At SILFEN sustainability means putting action behind words,
            considering all stakeholders and always aiming a little bit higher
            when creating another collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a young, global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the
            planet, not only for our own sake, but for all future generations to
            come.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why every piece is made with sustainable fabrics, for an
            experience that is not only luxurious, but responsible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collections are released as limited editions, because we are mindful
            of quality and quantity’s impact on both our present and our future.
          </p>
          <p>We hope to see you there.</p>

            <h4>Organic cotton</h4>
            <p>
              Organic cotton has the same qualities as conventional cotton but
              without the same environmental impact, as it is grown without the
              use of pesticides, insecticides or fertiliser.
            </p>
            <p>
              80 percent of organic cotton globally is grown in rainfed
              conditions. As a result, organic cotton has 91% lower water
              consumption than regular cotton.
            </p>
            <p>
              Farming practices used in organic agriculture, such as crop
              rotation, green manure, composting, reduced tillage, and the
              recycling of crop residue, helps increase the amount of organic
              matter in the soil. This improves water quality in agriculture
              areas where pollution has been a problem in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
              Organic agriculture offers a market-oriented solution to poverty
              among small farming communities and increases food security
              through crop rotation. Organic cotton also promotes gender
              equality as woman are more attracted to organic farming,
              increasing their financial independence.

            <h4>Recycled plastic</h4>
            <p>
              rPET leaves a smaller carbon footprint. It's 100% recyclable, Not
              only can it be cleaned and reused, it can also be recycled over
              and over again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creating a product out of rPet uses 75% less energy than new Pet
              (polyethylene terephthalate)
            </p>
            <p>
              RPET production produces 65.5% less carbon than virgin polyester.
            </p>
            <p>
              RPET production needs 1/10th of water compared to virgin
              polyester.
            </p>
            <p>
              RPET’s production needs only 30% of the energy required for virgin
              polyester’s production.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using plastic isn’t ideal but finding new life for already created
              plastics is a step in the right direction.

          <h3>OUR GOALS FOR THE FUTURE</h3>
          <p>
            At SILFEN we are trying our best to be more sustainable and save the
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            We still have a long way to go to be 100% sustainable. Below, you
            can read all about our goals for the future
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="goalsList">
          <h3>Goal 1 - SHIPPING</h3>
          <p>
            Current global circumstances have made it impossible to send our
            goods by ship or train. All products from our factories and
            warehouses and transported by plane. This is something we are aware
            of and are trying to rectify as soon as it is possible for us to do
            so.
          </p>
          <h3>Goal 2 - FACTORY VISITS</h3>
          <p>
            Since SILFEN began we have carried out regular visits to our
            production partners China, Turkey and India. Due to the global
            pandemic, visiting our factories in has been impossible. This is
            soon will change when it has been declared safe to travel to all
            countries and we can meet face to face with our workers again.
